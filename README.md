### :small_orange_diamond: User Stories
  * As a seller, I want to see a menu of all available kegs. For each keg, I want to see its name, brand, price and ABV(Alcohol by Volume).
  * As a seller, I want to submit a form to add a new keg to a list.
  * As a seller, I want to see how many pints are left in a keg. A full keg has roughly 124 pints.
  * As a seller, I want to be able to click a button next to a keg whenever I sell a pint of it. This should decrease the number of pints left by 1. Pints should not be able to go below 0.
  * As a seller, I want kegs with less than 10 pints to include a message that says "Almost Empty" so I can try a pint before it's gone!
  * As a seller, I want a keg to update to say "Out of Stock" once it's empty.
  * As a seller, I want to be able to click on a keg to see its detail page.
  * As a seller, I want the option to edit a keg's properties after entering them just in case I make a mistake.
  * As a seller, I want to be able to delete a keg.
  * As a seller, I want to have kegs stock message to be color-coded for easy readability. This is based on the amount of pints left.
